Permission is hereby granted in perpetuity, without payment of license fees 
or royalties, to use, copy, or distribute the RELMA(r) program, RELMA(r) 
Users' Manual, RELMA(r) Release Notes, RELMA(r) database and associated

and the LOINC Committee), LOINC(r) Release Notes, LOINC(r) Changes File, 
LOINC(r) panels and forms file, and LOINC(r) hierarchies file (collectively, 
the "Licensed Materials") for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, 
subject to the following terms and conditions:
      
      1) To prevent the dilution of the purpose of the LOINC codes and LOINC 
         table of providing a definitive standard for identifying clinical 
         information in electronic reports, users shall not use any of the 
         Licensed Materials for the purpose of developing or promulgating a 
         different standard for identifying patient observations, such as 
         laboratory test results; other diagnostic service test results; 
         clinical observations and measurements; reports produced by 
         clinicians and diagnostic services about patients; panels, forms 
         and collections that define aggregations of these observations; 
         and orders for these entities  in electronic reports and messages.
					
      2) If the user elects to utilize the RELMA program, users receive the 
         full RELMA database and associated search index files with the 
         RELMA program, including the LOINC table and other database tables 
         comprising the RELMA database.  In addition to its use with the 
         RELMA program, users may use the LOINC table by itself and may 
         modify the LOINC table as permitted herein.  Users may not use 
         or modify the other database tables from the RELMA database or the 
         associated search index files except in conjunction with their 
         authorized use of the RELMA program, unless prior written 
         permission is granted by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc.  To 
         request written permission, please contact loinc@regenstrief.org.
					
      3) Users shall not change the meaning of any of the LOINC codes.  
         Users shall not change the name of, or any contents of, any fields 
         in the LOINC table.  Users may add new fields to the LOINC table 
         to attach additional information to existing LOINC records.  Users 
         shall not change the content or structure of the LOINC panels and 
         forms from the LOINC panels and forms file, but may notify the 
         Regenstrief Institute of any potential inconsistencies or corrections 
         needed by contacting loinc@regenstrief.org. 
					
      4) A user may delete records from the LOINC table to deal with the 
         user's local requirements.  A user also may add new records to the 
         LOINC table to deal with the users' local requirements, provided that 
         if new records are added, any new entry in the LOINC_NUM field  
         of such new records must contain a leading alphabetic "X" so that 
         the new codes and records cannot be confused with existing LOINC 
         codes or new LOINC codes as they are defined in later releases of 
         the LOINC table.  Records deleted or added by users to deal with 
         local requirements are not reflected in the official LOINC table 
         maintained by the Regenstrief Institute and the LOINC Committee.  
         Users must also make reasonable efforts to submit requests to LOINC 
         for new records to cover observations that are not found in the 
         LOINC table in order to minimize the need for X-codes.
					
      5) LOINC codes and other information from the LOINC table may be used 
         in electronic messages for laboratory test results and clinical 
         observations such as HL7 ORU messages, without the need to include 
         this Copyright Notice and License or a reference thereto in the 
         message (and without the need to include all fields required by 
         Section 7 hereof).  When the LOINC code (from the LOINC_NUM field) 
         is included in the message, users are encouraged, but not required, 
         to include the corresponding LOINC short name (from the SHORTNAME 
         field) or the LOINC long common name (from the LONG_COMMON_NAME 
         field) in the message if the message provides a place for a text 
         name representation of the code. 

      6) Users may make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the 
         Licensed Materials.  Each copy thereof must include this Copyright 
         Notice and License, and must include the appropriate version number 
         of the Licensed Materials if the Licensed Materials have a version 
         number, or the release date if the Licensed Materials do not have 
         a version number.  This Copyright Notice and License must appear 
         on every printed copy of the LOINC table.  Where the Licensed 
         Materials are distributed on a fixed storage medium (such as 
         diskette or CD-ROM), a printed copy of this Copyright Notice and 
         License must be included on or with the storage medium, and a text 
         file containing this information also must be stored on the storage 
         medium in a file called "license.txt".  Where the Licensed 
         Materials are distributed via the Internet, this Copyright Notice 
         and License must be accessible on the same Internet page from which the 
         Licensed Materials are available for download. This Copyright Notice 
         and License must appear verbatim on every electronic or printed copy 
         of the RELMA Users' Manual and the LOINC Users' Guide.  The RELMA 
         Users' Manual and the LOINC Users' Guide may not be modified, nor 
         may derivative works of the RELMA Users' Manual or LOINC Users' 
         Guide be created, without the prior written permission of the 
         Regenstrief Institute, Inc.  To request written permission, please 
         contact loinc@regenstrief.org.  The Regenstrief Institute retains 
         the right to approve any modification to, or derivative work of, 
         the RELMA Users' Manual or the LOINC Users' Guide.

      7) Subject to Section 1 and the other restrictions hereof, users may 
         incorporate portions of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms file, 
         and LOINC hierarchies file into another master term dictionary 
         (e.g. laboratory test definition database), or software program for 
         distribution outside of the user's corporation or organization, 
         provided that any such master term dictionary or software program 
         includes the following fields reproduced in their entirety from the 
         LOINC table: LOINC_NUM, COMPONENT, PROPERTY, TIME_ASPCT, SYSTEM, 
         SCALE_TYP, METHOD_TYP,  STATUS, and SHORTNAME. Users are also 
         required to either: (1) include the EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE or 
         (2) delete the rows that include third party copyrighted content 
         (e.g., third party survey instruments and answers). If third party 
         content is included, users are required to comply with any such 
         third party copyright license terms. Users are encouraged, but not 
         required, to also include the RelatedNames2 and the LONG_COMMON_NAME 
         in any such database.  Further description of these fields is provided 
         in Appendix A of the LOINC Users' Guide.  Every copy of the LOINC 
         table, LOINC panels and forms file, and/or LOINC hierarchies 
         file incorporated into or distributed in conjunction with another 
         database or software program must include the following notice:  

               "This product includes all or a portion of the LOINC(r) 
                table, LOINC panels and forms file, and/or LOINC hierarchies 
                file, or is derived from one or more of the foregoing, 
                subject to a license from Regenstrief Institute, Inc.  
                Your use of the LOINC table, LOINC codes, LOINC panels 
                and forms file, and LOINC hierarchies file also is subject

                Notice of Third Party Content and Copyright Terms

A small portion of the content of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms, LOINC 
hierarchies, RELMA database and associated search index files consists of content 
subject to copyright from third parties. This third party content is either used 
with permission or under the applicable terms of use. In all such cases, we have 
included the copyright notice. This third party content is highlighted in the 
program as follows: When such copyright content appears in the RELMA look-up 
grid, RELMA will highlight the row containing that content by printing in a 
different background color and using italics. It will also include a link in the 
(EXT (C)) column. By clicking on that link, users will get to the copyright 
notice and to the terms of use for the content of those LOINC-mapped terms. In 
the case of a LOINC table (e.g. the tab delimited file or the LOINC Access 
database) we include the copyright notice (up to 250 characters).

We have included third party content that allows use and distribution at least 
for clinical, administrative and research purposes. The third party copyright 
owners generally ask for attribution of the source, allow the free use of the 
content for treatment, health care management, and research purposes. They 
generally forbid alteration of their content (e.g., survey questions and/or 
answers) and use for commercial purpose, which usually means the direct sale of 
the survey instruments, but they often do allow use of their content in 
commercial software, medical record and other clinical database systems, and 
the messaging of patient information collected through the use of these 
instruments.  The details of the notice of copyright for any third party content 
can be found in association with the terms when using the RELMA look-up tool or 
the LOINC table. The copyright of the LOINC codes per se remain owned by 
Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee and subject to the LOINC 
Copyright Notice and License.

In the future, we expect to include many more survey instruments and 
questionnaires from third parties with permission (especially those required 
by the U.S. federal government for payment and reimbursement) and believe that 
cataloguing all of these data collection forms in one comprehensive system (the 
LOINC table) along with laboratory and other clinical variables will facilitate 
the use of this data in direct clinical care, research and practice management.
