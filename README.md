Terminology Server
==================

The main function of a terminology server is the computer-aided representation/expostulation of medical terminologies as well as offering services to access them (completely or partially) and attribute based code systems. The following pages will give a survey of the terminology server of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund. The terminology server itself is a composition of several web services and we developed a terminology browser to display and maintain the contents. To aid the development of terminologies in a team we also created a collaboration environment.
